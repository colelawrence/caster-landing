## The Challenge

> “Most dangerous kind of waste is the waste we don’t recognize”
> <br> - Shigeo Shingo

When it comes to product development, many companies jump right to design, assuming they know what customers need, and then ship the finished product as soon as possible. Few leaders make it a strategic priority to talk with their customers or suffer from customer amnesia, as though they’ve forgotten how to have routine conversations with their customers.  Too much money is lost in designing, producing and shipping things for which customers see no value.

## The Approach

> “Client-centricity is the most important factor in a successful business digitalization, since client-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies not focused on the customer”
> <br>– Deloitte, July 2017
